# Data.Map.NonEmpty - NonEmptyMap [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/ChristopherDavenport/NonEmptyMap.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/ChristopherDavenport/NonEmptyMap)

This map implementation is a NonEmptyMap that can be used where that is necessary. Hopefully slowly porting over more and more functions from the containers libraries.

There is a lot more work to be done, so please feel free to help get this operational.
